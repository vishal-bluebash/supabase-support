Implementation Example with Task Queues
Here's an example workflow using a task queue with Supabase and an external processing service:

1) Create a Task Table:
  Store tasks and their statuses.

2) Insert Task into Queue: (Use edge function)

3) Add a new task entry when processing is required.
   Background Worker Setup:

4) Use a separate server or service (e.g., a small EC2 instance, DigitalOcean droplet, or a local machine) to run a background worker that polls for tasks.
Process Task in Background:

5) The worker processes each task and updates the task status in the database when completed.
  Monitor Task Progress



### Step-by-Step Implementation
Install Dependencies:

Use the following command to set up a new Node.js project and install @supabase/supabase-js:

```
mkdir background-worker
cd background-worker
npm init -y
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

And use code from worker.js file
